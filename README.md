# Steps Tracker Program

A Python program that helps users analyze their daily step count over a month. It calculates the maximum, minimum, and average number of steps and sorts the step data in descending order.

## Features
- Accepts daily step counts for a 30-day month.
- Calculates:
  - Maximum steps in a day.
  - Minimum steps in a day.
  - Average daily steps.
- Sorts step counts in descending order.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input step counts for 30 days as space-separated numbers.
2. It validates the input to ensure:
   - Exactly 30 values are provided.
   - All values are valid numbers.
3. If valid, it computes and displays:
   - Maximum and minimum step counts.
   - Average step count.
   - A sorted list of step counts in descending order.
