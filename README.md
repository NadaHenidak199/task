# Steps Tracker Program

A Python program that helps users analyze their daily step count over a month. It calculates the maximum, minimum, and average number of steps and sorts the step data in descending order.

## Features
- Accepts daily step counts for a 30-day month.
- Calculates:
  - Maximum steps in a day.
  - Minimum steps in a day.
  - Average daily steps.
- Sorts step counts in descending order.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input step counts for 30 days as space-separated numbers.
2. It validates the input to ensure:
   - Exactly 30 values are provided.
   - All values are valid numbers.
3. If valid, it computes and displays:
   - Maximum and minimum step counts.
   - Average step count.
   - A sorted list of step counts in descending order.



# Library Book Borrowing Analysis

A Python program that analyzes library book borrowing records for a given month. It calculates key metrics such as the most and least borrowed books, average borrowing time, and provides additional insights.

## Features
- *Data Input:* Accepts borrowing records in the format: "Book Title - Days Borrowed".
- *Calculations:*
  - Most and least borrowed books based on total days.
  - Average borrowing time across all books.
  - Unique book titles.
- *Sorting:* Sorts books by total borrowing duration in descending order.
- *Data Structures Used:*
  - *Dictionary:* To store book titles and their total borrowed days.
  - *Set:* To find unique book titles.

## How It Works
1. Parse borrowing records to extract book titles and their borrowed durations.
2. Use a dictionary to aggregate the total borrowed days for each book.
3. Calculate:
   - Most and least borrowed books.
   - Average borrowing time.
   - Unique book titles.
4. Sort the books based on total borrowing days in descending order.
